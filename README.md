# KnowUrBudget

KnowUrBudget is a crossplatform app available on web, desktop & mobile. It helps to manage your expenses monthly. You can view the evolution and where your money goes with graphs based on the expense type into a main dashboard. The app aims to be minimalistic and user friendly. Graphics are simple to analyze. A monthly limit must be set to get the application to work correctly and to show the evolution based on that limit.

The app is offline first but if the user decides to sync his data between his devices (web, desktop, mobile) he has to create an account.
With this application people having problems managing their budget will have keys to control their money to see which part of their expenses require the most money. Based on that information they can adjust their budget and spend money in a smarter way.
